    "chapo": "   Four years ago, Canon launched a 15-Mpix compact sensor for the Canon PowerShot G10, but the RAW image quality was quite disappointing. A year later, the Canon PowerShot G11, successor to the PowerShot G10, featured a 10 MPix sensor which was much better in low-light conditions that its predecessor.Since then and until this year, Canon's high-end compacts (Canon PowerShot S90 and&nbsp;Canon PowerShot S95) didn&rsquo;t push their resolution any further.But today, with a 13 MPix sensor, the new&nbsp;Canon PowerShot S100 is a new milestone for Canon, much better this time.Indeed, even with a 3 Mpix higher resolution, Canon",
