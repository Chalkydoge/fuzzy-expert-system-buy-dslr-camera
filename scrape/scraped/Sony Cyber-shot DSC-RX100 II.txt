    "chapo": "   Introduction  When Sony launched the Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 in June 2012 it was well received for the compact dimensions and handy 28-100mm (equivalent) zoom range, but the main attraction was the imaging performance from its much larger than usual 1-inch type sensor. As the name suggests the RX100 II is this year&rsquo;s update, adding a number of useful refinements, including a hotshoe (importantly, with provision for a EVF), Wi-Fi with NFC capabilities and a pull-out rear LCD. It retains the 20-MPix pixel count of its predecessor but perhaps the most significant revision to this model is the",
